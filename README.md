# CountdownButton

React experiment to create a Countdown Button similar to those used on Disney+ and Netflix when you complete an episode of a series and there is another episode queued up ready to play.

The `onComplete` prop will fire once the timer countdown has reached 0.

The `onClick` prop fires when the button is clicked on, this is regardless of whether the timer has reach zero and will also clear the timer interval.
